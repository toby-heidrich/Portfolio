### Projects
#### Data Visualization
The purpose of this project was to use Tableau to create data visualizations. Given our choice of dataset, we explored and aggregated the data to create these visualizations that answer our proposed research questions.
I chose to work with 3 different datasets containing data on global investment in renewable energy, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and CO2 emissions by country. The results are shown in the following poster.
