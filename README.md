### Education
Computational and Data Sciences, B.S. (In-Progress)

### Projects
#### Data Visualization
The purpose of this project was to use Tableau to create data visualizations. Given our choice of dataset, we explored and aggregated the data to create these visualizations that answer our proposed research questions.
I chose to work with 3 different datasets containing data on global investment in renewable energy, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and CO2 emissions by country. The results are shown in the following poster.

#### Database Design & SQL Queries
The purpose of this project is to design and build a database in SQL, and then run queries on that database. I did so by using the ER diagram method to map out entities and relationships and subsequently reducing the ER diagram to a relational diagram. I then constructed the database in SQL, filling it with phony data as per project requirements. Once the database was constructed, I conducted many queries on the data, including nested queries.
